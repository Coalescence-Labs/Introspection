# Introspection

A simple tool to help you gain deeper insights from your AI conversations.

## Overview

Introspection provides thoughtfully crafted questions designed to help you reflect on and extract value from your past AI chat conversations. Rather than letting valuable insights fade away, use these prompts to uncover patterns, ideas, and actionable next steps from your AI interactions.

## The Problem

We have countless conversations with AI assistants, exploring ideas, solving problems, and brainstorming. But how often do we step back and ask:
- What patterns emerge from my conversations?
- What's the most interesting idea I've explored?
- What should I focus on next?
- How can I apply what I've learned?

Introspection makes this reflection effortless.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Focus** - Select from curated introspection questions like:
   - "What's the craziest thing I've thought of so far?"
   - "What new topic would be best for me to explore next?"
   - "What can I specifically do to make the next step in my career?"

2. **Select Your LLM** - Pick which AI assistant you'll be asking (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

3. **Copy & Ask** - Get an optimized prompt tailored specifically for that LLM, ready to paste into your conversation

## Key Features

### Simple & Accessible
- Clean, straightforward interface anyone can use
- No technical knowledge required
- Works with any LLM you prefer

### LLM-Optimized Prompts
Behind each simple question is a carefully researched, refined prompt that:
- Uses the most effective phrasing for that specific LLM
- Includes explicit instructions to maximize quality responses
- Leverages each model's unique strengths

### Two-Layer Design
- **What you see**: A clear, simple question
- **What gets copied**: A comprehensive, optimized prompt engineered for best results

### Speech-Friendly Responses
- Option to request a TTS-optimized version of the LLM's response
- Formatted for natural text-to-speech playback
- Compatible with:
  - Native LLM voice features (ChatGPT Voice, Claude voice modes)
  - ElevenLabs
  - Any other TTS service
- Removes markdown, adds natural pauses, uses conversational phrasing

## Use Cases

- **Daily Reflection** - Check in with your AI conversation history each day
- **Career Development** - Identify actionable insights for professional growth
- **Idea Mining** - Surface creative concepts from past brainstorming sessions
- **Learning Optimization** - Discover knowledge gaps and learning opportunities
- **Pattern Recognition** - Understand your thinking patterns and interests over time

## Philosophy

Introspection is built on the belief that:
1. Our AI conversations contain valuable insights we often overlook
2. The right questions unlock the right answers
3. Tools should be simple, not complicated
4. Different AIs respond best to different prompt styles
